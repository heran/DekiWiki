The Gallery Macro from confluence is not being converted, so need to either remove it or replace it.

In order to categories the spaces use teamlabels in the format
mt-demospace/level2/level3 
where mt- is the required keyword for the teamlabel to be considered by the converter for conversion hirarchy.
Configure <fallbackSpacePrefix> (without the mt- prefix) to set the fallback root page offsets when the teamlabel isn't applied.

the teamlabel can then have the exact mapping as required in mindtouch.
